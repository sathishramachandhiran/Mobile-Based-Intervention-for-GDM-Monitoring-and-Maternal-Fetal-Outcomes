# GDM Web-Based Mobile-Mediated Intervention System

A web-based healthcare application designed to support the monitoring and management of **Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)** by tracking biochemical and biophysical parameters, generating alerts, and enabling clinical supervision through role-based access.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication that requires continuous monitoring and timely clinical intervention. Traditional care models rely heavily on periodic hospital visits and manual record keeping, which may delay detection of abnormal health conditions.

This project proposes a **web-based mobile-mediated intervention system** that enables:
- Continuous glucose and lifestyle monitoring
- Real-time alerts for abnormal values
- Doctor and nurse supervision
- Digital education for pregnant mothers

The system aims to improve **maternal and fetal outcomes** through technology-driven healthcare support.

- Track biophysical parameters like diet, exercise, and weight
- Provide real-time alerts for abnormal health conditions
- Enable doctors and nurses to review patient data remotely
- Improve patient awareness through educational resources
- Reduce dependency on frequent hospital visits
